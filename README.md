# "Export Responsive Image Set" GIMP Menu Item

Adds a menu item to GIMP under File/Create to load a source image and export a set of responsive images at varying resolutions for web use.

This is a work-in-progress for personal use, likely Windows only because of path handling. Written in Script-Fu to brush up on my scheme.
